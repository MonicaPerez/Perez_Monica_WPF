//If or Else Condtion

//sunny = true;
if (sunny){
	goToTheBeach();

	if(warmWater){
		wearNewSuit();
}
}else{ 
	goToTheMovies();
}


temp = 82
if(temp>70){
	goToTheBeach
}

//Conditional Logic

var oldEnough = true;
//if the is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
if(oldEnough){
	//code performed if condition is true
	console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}
